# File Generator CLI Tool

A Python-based command-line interface tool for generating various types of files with random data for testing and demonstration purposes.

## Features

- Generate multiple file types including:
  - Document files (TXT, PDF, DOCX)
  - Image files (PNG, JPG)
  - Vector files (SVG)
  - Advanced random data files

## Installation

1. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the CLI tool:
```bash
python cli.py
```

Navigate through the menu system to select the type of file you want to generate and specify the desired size.

## Development Plan

This project is being developed in phases as outlined in `Plan.md`:

- **Phase 1**: Core CLI functionality and TXT file generation
- **Phase 2**: Image file generation (PNG, JPG)
- **Phase 3**: Complex document and vector file generation (PDF, DOCX, SVG)
- **Phase 4**: Advanced features and finalization

## Disclaimer

The files generated by this tool contain random data and are intended for testing purposes only. The "Advanced (Unsafe) Generation" feature creates files without proper headers, which will likely be corrupt and unopenable.
