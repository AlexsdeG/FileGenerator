# File Generator CLI Tool

A Python-based command-line interface tool for generating various types of files with random data for testing and demonstration purposes.

## Features

- Generate multiple file types including:
  - Document files (TXT, PDF, DOCX)
  - Image files (PNG, JPG)
  - Vector files (SVG)
  - Advanced random data files

## Installation

1. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the CLI tool:
```bash
python cli.py
```

Navigate through the menu system to select the type of file you want to generate and specify the desired size.

## Development Status

### Phase 1: âœ… Complete
- Core CLI functionality with console-menu
- TXT file generation with random data
- Basic utilities for file size handling
- Input validation and error handling

### Phase 2: âœ… Complete  
- PNG file generation with valid headers
- JPG file generation with valid headers
- Precise file size control
- Image format validation

### Phase 3: âœ… Complete
- PDF file generation with structured content
- DOCX file generation with structured content
- SVG vector file generation with XML validation
- Enhanced file organization (all files saved in 'generated' folder)
- Smart filename handling with default extensions

### Phase 4: ðŸ”„ Pending
- Advanced random data generation
- Enhanced user input with size parsing (MB, GB)
- Final documentation and testing

## Testing

Run the test scripts to verify functionality:
```bash
# Phase 1 tests
python test_phase1.py

# Phase 2 tests
python test_phase2.py

# Phase 3 tests
python test_phase3.py
```

## Demo

Run demo scripts to see examples:
```bash
# Phase 1 demo
python demo.py

# Phase 2 demo  
python demo_phase2.py

# Phase 3 demo
python demo_phase3.py
```

## Development Plan

This project is being developed in phases as outlined in `Plan.md`:

- **Phase 1**: Core CLI functionality and TXT file generation âœ…
- **Phase 2**: Image file generation (PNG, JPG) âœ…
- **Phase 3**: Complex document and vector file generation (PDF, DOCX, SVG) âœ…
- **Phase 4**: Advanced features and finalization

## Key Features

### Smart File Handling
- **Default Extensions**: If no extension is provided, the tool automatically appends the appropriate extension (e.g., "test" becomes "test.txt")
- **Organized Storage**: All generated files are saved in a dedicated `generated/` folder to keep the project directory clean
- **Precise Size Control**: Files are generated with accurate size control, accounting for format-specific overhead

### Format Validation
- **Images**: PNG and JPG files include valid headers and can be opened by image viewers
- **Documents**: PDF files have proper PDF signatures and structure
- **Vector Files**: SVG files are valid XML that can be rendered by browsers
- **Office Documents**: DOCX files have valid ZIP structure and can be opened by office applications

## Disclaimer

The files generated by this tool contain random data and are intended for testing purposes only. The "Advanced (Unsafe) Generation" feature creates files without proper headers, which will likely be corrupt and unopenable.
